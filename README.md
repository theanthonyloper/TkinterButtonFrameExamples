# TkinterButtonFrameExamples
I tend to reuse this structure as it's nice &amp; easy for consolidating high-frequency scripts into one handy hub.

There are three basic examples: Horizontal buttons, Vertical Buttons, & Vertical buttons in two Frames which lie in the mainframe.

Add in ", command = calledfunc" to get the buttons to do something and add some color in there with fg & bg args.
